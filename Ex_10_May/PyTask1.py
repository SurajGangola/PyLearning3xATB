#Task #1
#Difference between = and == Operators in Python= Operator:This is the assignment operator.
# It is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable
# x.== Operator: This is the equality operator. It is used to compare two values to see if they are equal.
# For example, x == 5 checks if the value of x is equal to 5.


#What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?

#The ** Operator in Python
#The ** operator is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise a number to the power of another number.
#For example, 2 ** 3 calculates (2) raised to the power of (3), which equals (8).


#What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?
#The ^ Operator in Python
#The ^ operator is the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It is used to compare each bit of two numbers and returns a new number whose bits are set to 1 where the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1.
#For example, 5 ^ 3 results in 6 because the binary representation of 5 is 101 and 3 is 011, and the XOR operation results in 110 which is 6 in decimal.
